             <!-- Project Bacground -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Project Background</h2>
    <p class="project_text">memoLive is an innovative digital service that allows users to relive vanished 
                            or transformed places through personal and collective memories. This project was 
                            designed to address the issue of memory preservation and transmission in an ever-evolving 
                            world, while providing an immersive and interactive experience.</p>
        <!-- Context -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Context</h2>
    <p class="project_text">In a world where places, buildings, and cultural spaces often disappear in favor of new 
                            constructions, memoLive offers a way to digitally preserve these places. The goal is to 
                            allow users to virtually recreate lost spaces based on personal or shared memories. 
                            This service is part of the theme of death in the digital age, offering a means for memory 
                            to endure beyond time.</p>
        <!-- Process -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Process</h2>
    <p class="project_text">The development of memoLive followed a structured process, beginning with identifying user 
                            needs and analyzing the key features. The design was carried out through several phases:</p>
    <ol class="project_text-list">
        <li>Identification of key features: adding memories, managing connected devices, and searching for locations.</li>
        <li>Wireframing and prototyping: creating low and high-fidelity mockups, as well as interactive prototypes to test 
            navigation and usability.</li>
        <li>User testing: collecting feedback to refine design decisions and improve the interface and user experience</li>                        
    </ol>
        <!-- Research -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Research</h2>
    <p class="project_text">To ensure the service aligned with user expectations, a phase of user research was conducted, 
                            including questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. This helped define the target audience: 
                            adults aged 18 to 60 with an interest in technology and history. The tests revealed that the collaborative 
                            aspect (sharing memories) and the ability to relive places were appreciated.</p>
        <!-- Design Goals -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Design Goals</h2>
    <p class="project_text"> The design goals were as follows:</p>
    <ul class="project_text-list">
        <li>Create an intuitive and accessible interface, even for users not familiar with immersive technologies.</li>
        <li>Provide an immersive experience that engages the five senses, including visual, auditory, and olfactory elements.</li>
        <li>Ensure smooth navigation, allowing users to easily add, view, and share memories.</li>                     
    </ul>
        <!-- Design Problems -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Design Problems</h2>
    <p class="project_text">Several design challenges arose during the project:</p>
    <ul class="project_text-list">
        <li>Memory privacy: How to ensure that memories shared by users are protected, 
            while offering an option for public sharing?</li>
        <li>Technological accessibility: How to make the service accessible to everyone, 
            including people who may not be comfortable with immersive technologies like connected glasses?</li>
        <li>Interface complexity: How to design an interface that is rich in features 
            but simple enough to avoid cognitive overload?</li>                      
    </ul>
        <!-- Design Decisions -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Design Decisions</h2>
    <p class="project_text">To address the identified challenges, several decisions were made:</p>
    <ul class="project_text-list">
        <li>Private and public modes: Users can choose to share their memories in private or public spaces, 
            ensuring privacy for personal data.</li>
        <li>Mobile and immersive versions: A simpler version accessible via smartphone was created for users 
            who do not wish to invest in connected glasses. The immersive version offers a richer experience with 
            olfactory and visual devices.</li>
        <li>Graphic design: A color palette inspired by sepia photographs was chosen to enhance the nostalgic aspect, 
            while a handwritten typography was used to create an emotional connection with users.</li>                     
    </ul>
        <!-- Reflections -->
    <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-steps">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="project_text">The memoLive project pushed the boundaries of digital design by combining memory, 
                            technology, and sensory experiences. User testing revealed high acceptance of the 
                            service, though adjustments are still needed to improve accessibility and simplify 
                            certain interactions.<br> on memory privacy and the use of connected glasses was 
                            particularly insightful. Going forward, improving the integration of immersive 
                            technologies and expanding collaborative features will be priorities.<br> project 
                            highlights the importance of UX design in innovative contexts, where simplicity and 
                            intuitiveness must prevail, while offering a rich and emotionally engaging experience.</p>
